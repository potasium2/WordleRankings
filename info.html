                <p>Hello, you're probably wondering—"Why did you quantify an over 70 day streak of Wordle games, played by some friends and other people you have never met,
                into an online ranked leaderboard system?"—And to be quite honest I don't really know.</p>
                
                <p>This initially started as coding 'practice' in C# where I was just simply making an algorithm to 'quantify an over 70 day streak of Wordle games'.
                I ended up moving everything over to HTML and Javascript as a part of web dev practice, mostly because I am taking an HTML and CSS class next semester, some
                I used this as an opportunity to get some practice in.</p>
                
                <p>Doesn't really answer the question of "why Wordle?" to say it directly; because why not. The data for the games was there, and it was something I was playing
                <span id="subText">(and getting a pretty good streak in)</span> so making a rating system seemed fun and I wanted to see where I would place. I'm not sure how some people would view
                me currently <span id="subText">(As of 01/08/2025)</span> being rank #1 as. That being whether I made the system around me being rank or cheated to get there. In any case,
                all of this was made in good fun, none of it should be treated as undeniable proof that I, Lifeline/potasium_/Noah, am the best Wordle player on the planet, just
                something I made for fun that other people can view and compete in for fun :)</p>

                <p>I also want to use this page as like a means of answering some questions people may have, so heres like a quick Q&A of sorts:</p>

                <h1>Q: What does WR stand for?</h1>
                <h1>A: WR stands for Wordle Rating. I know it looks like 'World Record' but between that, Performance Points, and Competitive Rating, I think I made
                the right choice.</h1>
                <div id="spacing"> </div>

                <h1>Q: What is the value between rank and a players profile picture?</h1>
                <h1>A: That is the rank change, the furthest it looks back is 2 weeks. If a person has joined less than 2 weeks ago then it looks back to the day that person
                first joined.</h1>
                <div id="spacing"> </div>

                <h1>Q: What are the "Old Rankings"?</h1>
                <h1>A: The Old Leaderboard is the original iteration of the rating system. It was heavily unbalanced and favored playing on days where a lot of people
                played. It's mostly just there for comparison sake.</h1>
                <div id="spacing"> </div>

                <h1>Q: What is #1 Count?</h1>
                <h1>A: #1 Count is how many times you achieved the best guess count out of everyone for a day, this can be tied with multiple people, so it is possible for this
                count to go up for multiple people in a day.</h1>
                <div id="spacing"> </div>

                <h1>Q: What do the background colors on the rankings page signify?</h1>
                <h1>A: There are three colors that a person can have on their ranking banner: 
                <span id="activeText">Active</span>, <span id="inactiveText">Inactive</span>, and <span id="warningText">Warning</span>.</h1>
                <h1><span id="activeText">Active</span> means that a person is active and has played the wordle within' the last 30 days.</h1>
                <h1><span id="inactiveText">Inactive</span> means that a person has not played the Wordle within' the last 31-60 days. If a player is inactive
                for more than 60 days than their banner will be removed from the rankings listing.</h1>
                <h1><span id="warningText">Warning</span> means that a person has confirmed cheated on a previous Wordle. If a player gets 'tagged' more than
                3 times in a short period then their name will be temporarily removed from the rankings listing. Being tagged and 'banned' will not prevent
                someone from still gaining rating, it will just remove them from the leaderboards.</h1>
